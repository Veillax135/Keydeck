### **7. Feedback & Iteration**


**Testing Strategy**:



* **Alpha**: Conduct internal closed-loop testing with a small group using specific hardware-attached keys to refine functionality.
* **Beta**: Expand to external closed-loop testing, allowing a larger group to provide feedback while still using hardware-attached keys.
* **Release Candidate**: Open-loop testing with larger groups, removing hardware dependencies for broader user engagement.
* **Release**: Launch the external open-loop release, making the project free and open-source with a GNU-GPL-v3 license.

**User Feedback**:



* Collect feedback through dedicated email channels and a feedback section on the GitHub repository, encouraging users to report bugs and suggest features.

**Continuous Improvement**:



* Maintain a development cycle of A -> B -> RC -> PR format, iterating based on user feedback and ensuring the roadmap is flexible to accommodate new insights and feature requests.
